## Docker commands to execute complete pipeline with DVC

```bash
# 1. Build the Docker Image
docker-compose build
# 2. Run the Container
docker-compose up
```
```bash
# 3. Stop and Remove Containers
docker-compose down
```

## DVC Pipeline Execution command without using docker:

```bash
python3 -m venv .mlops_venv  # Create a new virtual environment in the .mlops_venv directory
source .mlops_venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment

pip install -e .  # Install the current package in editable mode

dvc init  # Initialize a new DVC repository

dvc get https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS transactions.zip -o data/raw/zipped/
dvc add data/raw/zipped/transactions.zip

dvc dag  # Display the DVC pipeline as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

# To execute a machine learning pipeline defined in DVC, you can use the following command
# This will execute Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Training, and Evaluation stages
# as defined in the dvc.yaml file, in the correct order and only if there are changes
dvc repro

# Add Google Drive as a remote storage for DVC
# Replace 'myremote' with your preferred remote name
# Replace 'folder_id' with the actual ID of your Google Drive folder
dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://folder_id/path/to/dvc/storage

python3 src/gdrive_setup/setup_dvc_remote.py  # Run a script to set up the DVC remote configuration with gdrve client secret keys

git push  # Push dvc data changes to the Google drive or any other remote source like AWS (as set in the files)
```

# notebook description
--------
- `1_load_data_exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for loading and understanding the dataset.
- `2_data_visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data visualization and plotting.
- `3_data_wrangling_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data wrangling, EDA, data preparation, and building machine learning models.

- `5-model-deployment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data visualization and plotting (in progress).

- **Notebook 1: 1_load_data_exploration.ipynb**: 
In this initial notebook, I focused on establishing a strong foundation for the project. I meticulously loaded the dataset from github file and extracted the zip file in data folder, ensuring its integrity and consistency. This step was crucial to ensure that subsequent analyses and modeling were built upon reliable data. Afterwards, I worked on basic data exploration of Categorical, Numerical, and Datetime attributes and data structure.

- **Notebook 2: 2_data_visualization.ipynb**: 
With a solid foundation in place, I delved into the world of data visualization. This notebook was dedicated to unraveling the hidden patterns within the dataset. Through an array of plots, charts, and visualizations, I deciphered the distribution of features, uncovered potential correlations, and gained crucial insights into the underlying trends. These visual revelations served as guiding lights for subsequent decision-making.

- **Notebook 3: 3_data_wrangling_modeling.ipynb**: 
In the final phase of my exploration, I undertook comprehensive data wrangling and modeling endeavors. This notebook encapsulated the essence of my project, combining the insights from previous notebooks into actionable steps. Here, I embarked on an intricate journey: 
    - Duplicate Transaction Identification: I delved into the identification and analysis of multi-swipe and reversed duplicate transactions. This endeavor provided a deeper understanding of these transactions' impact on the overall dataset. 
    - Feature Engineering, Cleaning, and Normalization: With an eye for improvement, I engaged in feature engineering to harness the latent potential of the dataset. Additionally, I handled missing values and employed normalization techniques to ensure data consistency and reliability.
    - Effective Imbalanced Data Handling: Recognizing the importance of tackling data imbalance, I implemented an undersampling strategy with n iterations. This method effectively addressed the challenge while retaining the integrity of the dataset.
    - Advanced Modeling with Rigorous Evaluation: Armed with well-preprocessed data, I ventured into modeling armed with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Rigorous evaluation using key metrics helped ascertain the model's performance and suitability for the fraud detection task.
